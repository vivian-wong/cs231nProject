# Notes for TA/grader: 
- Results are in pipeline.ipynb
- See the two classifier.py files for functions of training, visualizing and data augmentation
- See utils.py for detailed helper functions

# Notes for other user: 
## Instructions for using your own data: 
- Create a data folder in the home directory
- Create sub-folders with the name of dataset (i our case, data/FMD, data/fire_new) 
- Under each sub-folder, have folders called /train and /val
- Under /train and /val, have folders with thei classes as folder names
- Place images in those class name folders 

### Now you should be able to run pipeline.ipnb with simple modification of the data_dir variables.
